    <h2>Our class is working really hard to get to know how to do basic coding.</h2>
<p>My name is Hung Thai, a.k.a Harry. 
I have never learnt about coding before.
I did not even think about learning something like this.
But I think that we are living in the era of Internet. 
Everything goes online, through the websites. 
We could shopping online. We could apply for Employment Insurance online. 
We could renew our Driver Licenses online. 
Thus, I think that I am taking the right program.</p>
